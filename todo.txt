 + turn app.Running into a context-aware api
 + FuncCh chan func() in App for controlling default loop
 + use a BaseWidget struct that implements Widget interface that other widget structs can embed
 + BaseWidget contains a controlling mutex
 + Hacker News reader app as an example (something with cond. rendering)
 + Run inits screen
 + Box widget has just a swappable Child (for conditional rendering)
 + Move examples into their own packages so they can be run remotely
 + Context interface with FocusedWidget()

embed struct:

struct BaseWidget:
  mutex

impl Widget for BaseWidget


struct MyLabel:
  BaseWidget
  label string

impl necessary Widget functions for BaseWidget, managing mutex myself


wrap actual Widget:

struct BaseWidget:
  mutex
  innerWidget



2025:

 - [X] Add GetChildren()
 - [X] Refactor DrawSize(boundsW, boundsH int) -> Bounds(space Rect)
 - [ ] Refactor all Widget functions that take a (previously) currentRect to
take a space Rect instead, for simplicity and control
 - [ ] Panic catch at App.Run to prevent the terminal from being f-ed up by mid-rendering logic
 - [ ] Rect.Expand and Contract (amt int)
